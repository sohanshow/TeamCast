**VISUAL**: All-22 elevated sideline view. The Detroit Lions offense lines up at the 50 yard line. The offense is in a shotgun formation with [PERSONNEL DETAILS - Example: 1 RB, 1 TE, 3 WR]. The Kansas City Chiefs defense shows a [DEFENSIVE FRONT DETAILS - Example: 4-3 Over] with [COVERAGE SHELL DETAILS - Example: two high safeties indicating Cover-2]. The play clock is winding down.

The receivers run a [ROUTE CONCEPT DETAILS - Example: quick game concept, with a slant route to the right, a fade route on the outside, and a hitch route to the left]. The intended target, the receiver running the slant route, is covered closely by the Chiefs' cornerback. Goff throws the ball quickly to the right side, but the pass is incomplete as the receiver is unable to create separation from the defender. [ANIMATE: Show route depth lines. Highlight coverage defender. Show throw trajectory].

**AUDIO**: (Coaching voiceover) ""Lions trying to exploit the short right side of the field with a quick slant, but the Chiefs corner jams the receiver effectively at the line, disrupting the timing and forcing an incompletion. Protection held up, but the lack of separation doomed the play.""

All-22 view, Lions-Chiefs. Pre-snap: Chiefs in shotgun, personnel TBD, formation suggests pass. Lions showing a light box, alignment TBD. Mahomes takes the snap. Lions drop into a zone coverage. McKinnon runs a quick flat route to the left. The offensive line provides adequate protection, allowing Mahomes time to deliver the short pass. Lions linebacker Rodriguez is slow to react to the flat, allowing McKinnon to secure the catch. The zone coverage leaves a soft spot on the perimeter, enabling McKinnon to turn upfield after the catch. Clear view of the yard markers as McKinnon gains 10 yards, converting the first down. Coverage breakdown evident.
